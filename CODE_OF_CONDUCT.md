# Code of Conduct

## Our pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment,
Chicago ML organizers pledge to make participation in our community a
harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size,
disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of
experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or
sexual identity and orientation.

## Our standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive
environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Respecting others&rsquo; personal space and physical boundaries
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual
  attention or advances
- Hostile, aggressive, or threatening language or behavior
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political
  attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others&rsquo; private information, such as a physical or
  electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in
  a professional setting

## Our responsibilities

Chicago ML organizers are responsible for clarifying the standards of
acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair
corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable
behavior.

Organizers have the right and responsibility to ban temporarily or
permanently any individual from Chicago ML events or projects for
behaviors that violate this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within event and project spaces and
in public spaces when an individual is representing Chicago ML or its
community. Examples of representing Chicago ML or its community
include attendance of Chicago ML sponsored or co-sponsored events,
participation in Chicago ML organizational activities, and
participation in Chicago ML online activities including but not
limited to use of the Chicago ML Meetup message board, Slack workspace
and GitHub repository.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior
may be reported by contacting [Chicago ML organizers][meetup-orgs]
through Meetup or directly to Garrett Smith at g@rre.tt or

and will respond in a way that they deem appropriate to the
circumstances. Organizers are obligated to maintain confidentiality
with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of
specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Individuals who do not follow this Code of Conduct in good faith may
