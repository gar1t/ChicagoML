Chicago ML is extremely excited to announce our first meetup with the
ML team at Fermilab - America's particle physics and accelerator
laboratory!

NOTE: This event is in Batavia, IL - 40 miles west of Chicago. If

We will be hearing from:

- Gabe Perdue - Deep learning for ghost particles
- Joao Calderia - Machine learning the universe
- Javier Duarte - The fastest inference at the highest energies
- Garrett Smith - Light weight workflow automation with Guild AI
