## Open Standards for Machine Learning Model Deployment

by Svetlana Levitan

Dr. Svetlana Levitan, Developer Advocate with Center for Open Source
Data and AI Technologies (CODAIT) at IBM, discuses open standards that
have made the process of model deployment easier.

Predictive model deployment is the part of the machine learning
process where the practical results are achieved, when the model is
used for generating predictions on new data (known as scoring). The
deployment used to present big difficulties, as models were typically
built in one environment and needed to be deployed in a different
one. Often they would need to be re-implemented in a new programming
language, that would be very slow and error-prone.

Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) and Portable Format for
Analytics (PFA) were developed by the Data Mining Group (DMG) that
originated in Chicago. PMML has been around for more than 20 years and
is used widely. PFA is an emerging standard that is getting a lot of
interest. Open Neural Network eXchange (ONNX) format was recently
developed by Facebook and Microsoft as a way to exchange deep learning
(DL) models between different DL frameworks, and is now experiencing
explosive growth. Attendees will get a good understanding of
predictive model deployment challenges and approaches.

Svetlana Levitan, PhD, is Developer Advocate with Center for Open
Source Data and AI Technologies (CODAIT) at IBM. She has been a
software engineer, architect, and technical lead for SPSS Analytic
components for many years. She represents IBM at the Data Mining Group
and is the release manager for PMML and PFA, open standards for
predictive model deployment. She is also working with other companies
on ONNX, an open model exchange format for deep learning
models. Svetlana is a co-organizer of several Chicagoland Meetup
groups, including Big Data Developers in Chicago, Chicago Cloud
Developers, Open Source Analytics. She has authored several blogs and
presented at many conferences and other events. Svetlana loves to
learn new technologies and to share her expertise, to encourage girls
and women in STEM.
