## Deciphering the Black Box: Understanding your Machine Learning Model

by Rajiv Shah

This talk will show how interpretability tools can give you not only
more confidence in a model, but also help to improve model
performance. This workshop will cover best practices for using
techniques such as feature importance, partial dependence, and
explanation approaches, such as LIME. Along the way, we will consider
issues like spurious correlation, multicollinearity, and other issues
that may affect model interpretation and performance. The talk will
use easy to understand examples and references to open source
algorithms to illustrate the techniques.

Rajiv Shah is a data scientist with DataRobot and an Adjunct Assistant
Professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago. He has previously
worked as a data scientist for State Farm and Caterpillar. He is an
active member of the data science community in Chicago. He has a PhD
from the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign.
