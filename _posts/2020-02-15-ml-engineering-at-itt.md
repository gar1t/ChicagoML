Join us for a full day, hands on workshop at IIT on machine learning
engineering!

ML engineering is the intersection of machine learning data science
and software/systems engineering. It's an emerging field that demands
a broad and deep skillset in multiple domains.

In this workshop, we teach ML engineering basics and spend the
remaining with hands-on, student-driven coding.

If you have an ML or data science project for school or work, you have
the option of working on it during the workshop. Otherwise we have
predefined exercises you can use.
